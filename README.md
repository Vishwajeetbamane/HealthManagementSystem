# HealthManagementSystem
Use Health Management System to track the Diet and Exercise of a person.
I made this program to track the Diet and Exercise of mine and my family members.
This program is for tracking four persons.That is why we need to make 2 text files for each person.One text file for Diet and one for Exercise.
While running the program,first you have to enter the name of person.Then it will ask if you want to save or retrieve your diet.If enter save then it will ask if you want to save diet or exercise.If you choose one among these two then you have to provide what you ate or what exercise you did.I have also used datetime module so that when you save your information,it will automatically append it with the current time in text files which we made.
If you want to retrieve the information saved,run the program again and enter the name.After entering retrieve,it will read the file and will show to you along with time.
I have given the names of my family members.You can change the names by editing the program and renaming the textfiles.
